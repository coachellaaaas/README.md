# Hello there, I'm Coach (church given name: Katheryne)!  👋
Computer Science & AI Graduate on an exciting journey into Finance!

## 🎯 A Bit About Me
I'm working toward breaking into Finance, and honestly? It's been quite the adventure! I'm a CS grad who loves the challenge of understanding how math meets markets, and I'm currently leveling up my Python and C++ skills along the way.
**Real talk:** I'm still building my confidence in coding, but that's part of the journey, right? Every bug I squash and every concept I finally "get" feels like a small victory. I believe in learning out loud and not being afraid to show the messy, in-progress stuff.

### **Documentation Style:**
* Every concept has: Theory → Implementation → Visualization → Real-world application
* Honest about what I struggle with, not just what I understand
* Code is heavily commented - explaining why, not just what

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **Languages:** Python, C++, SQL, R, MATLAB, Java
* **ML/DS:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy
* **Finance:** QuantLib (learning), Options Pricing, Risk Analytics
* **Tools:** Git, Linux, CUDA, Jupyter, VS Code
* **Specialisation:** Neural Networks (CNNs, SNNs), GPU Computing (GeNN/CUDA)
