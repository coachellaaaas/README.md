# Hello there, I'm Piyathida (Coach) 👋
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Graduate >3<

## 🔬 Featured Projects
### 🧠 Transfer Learning with Spiking Neural Networks
Aug 2024 - Apr 2025 | Bachelor's Thesis
Built a biologically-inspired recognition system using Spiking Neural Networks with GPU acceleration:

* 35% improvement over baseline models with 40% less training data
* Custom data pipelines for 50 alphabets, temporal encoding for spike-based learning
* Implemented EventProp (gradient computation for precise spike timing)
* Tech: Python, GeNN (pyGenn, mlGenn), NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, CUDA

**Key Learning:** Optimizing neural architectures isn't just about accuracy - it's about data efficiency and computational trade-offs.

### 📈 Quantitative Finance Journey (In Progress)
This is where I'm building my foundations for a quant career:
#### 🎲 quant-foundations (Main Learning Repo)
Systematic implementation of quantitative finance concepts from first principles.
**What's Inside:**

* **Probability & Statistics:** From coin flips to stochastic processes
* **Derivatives Pricing:** Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, binomial trees
* **Portfolio Theory:** Mean-variance optimization, efficient frontier, risk metrics
* **Market Microstructure:** Order book dynamics, trade execution

**Documentation Style:**

* Every concept has: Theory → Implementation → Visualization → Real-world application
* Honest about what I struggle with, not just what I understand
* Code is heavily commented - explaining why, not just what



## 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **Languages:** Python, C++, SQL, R, MATLAB, Java
* **ML/DS:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SciPy
* **Finance:** QuantLib (learning), Options Pricing, Risk Analytics
* **Tools:** Git, Linux, CUDA, Jupyter, VS Code
* **Specialisation:** Neural Networks (CNNs, SNNs), GPU Computing (GeNN/CUDA)


## 📫 Get in Touch
I'm actively seeking:

* **Mentorship** from quantitative finance professionals
* **Internship** **opportunities** in quant dev/research roles
* **Study partners** preparing for MScRMFE programs
* **Feedback** on my code, projects, and learning approach
